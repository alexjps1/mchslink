## About
A website and soon-to-be URL shortener for MCHS.
This project aims to create a practical website for sharing information about extracurricular activities at school.

## Dependencies
The website is using the following technologies, but alternatives can also be used:
- Debian server
- Nginx
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (of course)

## Branches
There are two branches for the development of the project:
- `main` (structure of elements on website)
- `live` (actual content currently on website)
In other words, the `live` branch contains actual content, while the `main` branch is like a template to which the content is added.
Changes to `main` will be merged into `live`, but never the other way around.
