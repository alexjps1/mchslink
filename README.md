# mchslink

## About
A website and URL shortener for MCHS.
This project aimed to create a practical website for sharing information about extracurricular activities at school.
It has served this purpose and is no longer in development.

The website (was) running live at [mchs.link](https://mchs.link) with the files in the `live` branch.

## Dependencies
The website is using the following technologies, but alternatives can also be used:
- Debian server  
- Nginx  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (of course)  

## Branches
As briefly as possible...
- `main` contains templates and underlying structure
- `live` is the current site contents (site no longer up)
- `dev2` is a defunct development branch for URL shortener
- `dev` has URL shortener code which runs locally
- `map-guide` has code for generating an interactive event map
